# Scalable Real-Time Recommendation Engine with MLOps

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development and deployment of a high-throughput, real-time recommendation system designed to serve millions of users. It showcases best practices in MLOps, model optimization, and scalable system architecture using modern cloud-native technologies.

**Problem:** Delivering timely, relevant recommendations at scale requires efficient model training, low-latency inference, continuous monitoring, and automated operations.

**Solution:** We built a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) approaches. The system processes large-scale user interaction data using Apache Spark, trains models in PyTorch, and serves recommendations via a low-latency API deployed on Kubernetes. A comprehensive MLOps pipeline using MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services (AWS/GCP) automates the ML lifecycle, including retraining, versioning, A/B testing deployment hooks, and real-time monitoring. Inference latency was significantly reduced using model quantization and optimized serving infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

*   **Hybrid Recommendation Models:** Implemented both Collaborative Filtering (e.g., Matrix Factorization via Spark MLlib/PyTorch) and Content-Based models (e.g., TF-IDF/Embeddings).
*   **Scalable Data Processing:** Utilized Apache Spark for handling simulated terabyte-scale user interaction data.
*   **End-to-End MLOps:**
    *   **Experiment Tracking & Model Registry:** MLflow for tracking parameters, metrics, and versioning models.
    *   **Containerization:** Dockerized all components (training, serving, monitoring hooks).
    *   **Orchestration & Deployment:** Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for scalable deployment and management of services.
    *   **Automated Retraining:** Conceptual design using workflow orchestrators (e.g., Airflow/Kubeflow) triggered by monitoring alerts or schedule.
    *   **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of API latency, throughput, error rates, and conceptual model drift detection hooks.
    *   **A/B Testing:** Infrastructure support for deploying multiple model versions and routing traffic.
*   **Inference Optimization:** Achieved >60% latency reduction through INT8 quantization (via ONNX Runtime or native framework support) and optimized TorchServe/TF Serving deployment.
*   **Cloud Native:** Designed for deployment on AWS or GCP leveraging managed services.

**Tech Stack:**

*   **Languages:** Python
*   **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, Spark MLlib, Scikit-learn
*   **Data Processing:** Apache Spark, Pandas
*   **MLOps:** MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Prometheus, Grafana (Conceptual), Airflow/Kubeflow (Conceptual)
*   **Serving:** TorchServe / TensorFlow Serving / Custom FastAPI with ONNX Runtime

**Results:**

*   Successfully simulated serving >10M active users with low latency.
*   Reduced P99 inference latency by over 60%.
*   Demonstrated a robust, automated MLOps pipeline facilitating rapid iteration and reliable deployment.
